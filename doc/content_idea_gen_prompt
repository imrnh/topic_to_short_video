Suggest me 10 short video (min length: 50 sec, max length: 2.5min) idea about nutrition.
I need something that can be researched by AI models. Like something plain and simple.

For example, "Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners: Which is Healthier?" 


In this case, i can look up contents in google scholar, pass them to AI model and will get an answer.

Suggest me 10 ideas like that. + 10 keyword for each item to look up in google scholar.


I need the following format for the content:

<VideoIdea>
	  <Title>Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners: Which is Healthier?</Title>
	  <Keywords> 
	      Aritifical Sweetners,
	      Harmful effect of Artifical Sweetners,
	      Why sugar is bad?,
	 </Keyword>
</VideoIdea>

here, make sure to keep each keyword item comma seperated.
